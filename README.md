# Ratmaze

by RobinIsTheBird

## Purpose

Ratmaze is the personal project of Robin Schaufler, aka Robin, like the bird or Robin is the bird, for a 2D exploration of 2D mazes: one dimension being maze construction algorithms, the other being languages and development platforms. The results of all the explorations should be visible mazes conforming to Robin's sense of aesthetics.

For now, all mazes will be 2D, on a square grid, occupying a rectangular region. The ideal maze is a labyrinth: no branches, and therefore no dead-ends and no loops. The plan is to fall short of the ideal, but proximity to the ideal is the standard for judging maze algorithms.

## Algorithms

Robin intends to invent her own algorithms rather than searching the web, for the entertainment value of sheer programming. Here is a list of algorithms and internal representations to try.
